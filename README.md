# 🎮 Zone 13

**Zone 13** is a tactical horror shooter built in **Godot 4**, set in a cold, decayed military quarantine zone. The focus is on atmospheric dread, immersive navigation, and tactical survival in an abandoned area filled with secrets.

## 🧠 Concept

You are a lone soldier sent to investigate a dead zone where communication has ceased. Your flashlight is your only guide. Fog, decayed buildings, and silence surround you... until it doesn’t.

- 🎯 Tactical shooter elements (cover, exploration)
- 👻 Psychological horror and immersive sound design
- 🌫️ Heavy fog and flashlight-based visibility
- 🏚️ Retro, green-tinted military decay aesthetic
