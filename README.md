# zone-13
Zone 13 is a tactical horror game prototype developed in Godot 4, featuring atmospheric fog, procedural terrain props, and flashlight-driven exploration. Inspired by games like PUBG, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and The Forest, this indie project focuses on psychological tension and isolated survival in a post-military quarantine zone.
