# 🧟 ZONE 13: Tactical Retro Horror Survival

> *“There are places the maps forgot — and we were told never to return. One of them is Zone 13.”*

**Zone 13** is a retro tactical horror survival game built with **Godot 4**, blending eerie exploration, fog-laced tension, and strategic movement. Set in a quarantined military zone long abandoned, you're dropped into a place where the fog remembers everything — even you.

## 🧠 Concept

- 🎯 A player-focused experience with low visibility and high paranoia
- 🌫️ Procedural terrain props like rocks, trees, and abandoned military structures
- 🔦 A flashlight-based navigation system heightening isolation and immersion
- 🎧 Ambient horror soundscapes set in a foggy, cursed battleground
- 📦 Built modularly — props, enemies, maps, and tension systems evolve over time
